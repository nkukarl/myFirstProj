This repo contains some practices when I start using PyCharm.
When markdown plugins are installed in PyCharm, you will be able to toggle between markdown editing page and HTML Preview page.

It also supports multiple line code mode such as:
```javascript
myFunc = () => {
    return 'Hello world';
}
```

```python
def myFunc():
    return 'Hello world'
```

`abc`
